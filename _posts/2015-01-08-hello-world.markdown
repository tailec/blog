Few weeks ago I came up with an idea of creating my personal corner. And finally it's there!

Mostly I will talk about iOS and mobile apps design. Upcoming posts will be related to iOS stuff that I am currently looking into (ReactiveCocoa, SpriteKit and animation frameworks).


\'Why tailec?\' you may ask. My surname translated to english means exactly 'Tailor'. So I picked 4 first letters from english equivalent and 2 last letters from original one. I believe it's easier to pronounce for english speakers.

Off the record I am not a native english speaker so bear with me if I make any mistake.
I hope that maintaining this website will help me to polish my english skills too :)

This blog is made with jekyll + bootstrap-sass and is maintained with help of glynn.
